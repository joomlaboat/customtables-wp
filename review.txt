What if we want to include a dynamic value inside the translation? Easy, you need to add a placeholder which will be part of the string and change it after the gettext function does its magic, you can use printf to do so, like this:

printf(
       /* translators: %s: First name of the user */
       esc_html__( 'Hello %s, how are you?', 'plugin-slug' ),
       esc_html( $user_firstname )
 );
