The CustomTables plugin allows you to create, manage, and display custom catalogs, forms and tables.

== Description ==

**Custom Tables** is a powerful plugin that allows you to add **custom database tables**, **fields**, and **layouts** to both **Joomla** and **WordPress**. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, including **catalogs**, **edit forms**, **detail pages**, and more.

One of the standout features of Custom Tables is its support for the modern **Twig template language**, providing a flexible and user-friendly way to create **dynamic layouts**.

With 10 **field types** to choose from, including **Integer**, **Decimal**, **Text String**, **Date**, **Email**, **Color**,
you can create complex **data structures** tailored to your specific needs.
The **edit form input boxes** dynamically adapt to the selected field type, ensuring a seamless user experience.
For example, the **Date field type** will display a **calendar**, and the **Color field type** will offer a **color picker**.

The **Layout Editor** with Twig language simplifies the process of creating new layouts by offering an **Auto-Create** button that generates a layout based on the list of fields in your table.

All tables are stored in **MySQL**, with **queries** and **field values** being properly **sanitized** to prevent potential **vulnerabilities** for added **security**.

With its rich **feature set** and **cross-platform compatibility**, Custom Tables is an indispensable tool for **developers** and **website administrators** seeking to extend the functionality of their Joomla or WordPress sites with **custom data structures** and **dynamic layouts**.
